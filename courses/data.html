            <p>The data module was pretty small, and its biggest experience was the project we conducted for the Big Data class. It was still a pretty short project, with 
              precise guidelines: <b>choose an interesting dataset to study, and analyze it using five charts in five pages.</b>
            </p>
            <p>Along with my group, we decided to study the Human Freedom Index, which gathers data and indicators about economical and personal freedom in all countries around 
              the world. It was really interesting to study and see correlation between factors that lead some countries to do well or bad economically or politically.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              From a technical standpoint, is was the opportunity for me to manipulate R and other data analysis tools outside of a controlled class environment, but rather in a 
              more free and open way. We also had to take into account good practices in terms of chart selection and clarity, which developped important skills in knowing how to make 
              information impactful and make the reader interested in what the numbers and values that you are showing him.

        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

          <div class="col-lg-7">
            <p>Having followed the Semantic Web class last year in 4IR-I, I was already familiar with most of the concepts overseen 
              during this class. The content of the lecture and the first lab, going over the definition of an Ontology, a Knowledge-base and 
              some conventions like RDFS, were elements I already knew and used. However, it still served as a resfresher, and prepared me 
              for the second lab, which focused on how to semantic web methods in IoT. <br>
              The context of the lab was simple: taking as an input sensor data from a smart city in Denmark, we were supposed to "enrich" the raw data 
              using an ontology we created. That way, we could add meaning to the data, allowing to reason and exploit it more easily. <br> 
              To do so, I had to create an MVC based architecture in Java that would parse the CSV data and transform it to an exploitable knowledge-base. 
              It mostly required skills in Java programming, which I had acquired in my previous years and from personal projects. Overall, this and the knowledge 
              about Semantic web I acquired last year and this year helped me to succeed for this lab.

        <h4>Big data</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p>While the Big Data lectures focused more on general data analysis concepts and good practice, the tutorials were mostly focused on learning 
          the R language and its plotting tool: ggplot2. However, it was important to know about what is relevent to plot and what is the correct chart 
          to show it before going into how to implement it.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-5">
            <div class="mt-4">
              <img src="../assets/img/birthyear.png" alt="GGplot example">
              <p class="mt-3" style="text-align: center; font-size: smaller;"><b>ggplot example, number of births per year by sex</b></p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-7">
            <p>When wanting to exploit a dataset to plot data using R, there are two main difficulties. 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>First, you need to transform the data from its original form in the dataset, to the way you want it in order to build your plot. It may involve sorting, 
                grouping values by year, computing average values. These are standard operations I was used to use in other languages, notably in Python. However, the 
                particularity of R (and the python package Pandas for example) is that it does not rely on classic iterative loops. <br> <b>There are no for or while loop in R.</b> 
                Fortunately, there are mapping functions, and especially the method <b>ddply</b>, which helps us do what we ususally do using for loops. It still was challenging 
                to have to think of another way to accomplish a task you have done many times.
              </li>
              <li>Second, you need to plot the data, choosing the right type of chart with correct parameters. It is key to have a chart that is readable, clear, and does not imply 
                a meaning that differs from the dataset. For example, choosing an incorrect scale or ignoring values can allow to reach conclusions from a chart that are not true if 
                you look to the dataset in detail. Here, it is important to remember the theoretical concepts of plotting, and also use some common sense to know what choice to make 
                and how to make the best of the data you have. Learning this through the tutorials helped me a lot movinf forward with the project.
              </li>
            </ul>
      
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In the end, this class involved theoretical skills learned during the lecture, but also technical skills gaine from the tutorials and some self-teaching in order 
          to master the R language. Basic knowledge of the Pandas python library was definitely helpful to me, especially when using data frames and iteration with ddply.
        </p>


        <h4>Software engineering</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />
        <p>The aim of this class was to give us an overview of the phases in software development, along with the main project management methods. Learning it through the lecture 
          was one thing, but the real task was to apply it for the different projects we would have during the year. The main method we were tasked to apply is the Agile method. 
          It is the most popular management method in software development and is widely used today. Personally, I used it in 4th Year at INSA for my research project and in my 4th Year 
          summer internship, in a startup of 17 employees. Using the Agile method was something I was familiar with, but during this class I used tools I had never used before, especially 
          <b>Icescrum</b>.
        </p>
        <p>We used this tool as part of the Service Oriented Architecture project (in a group of three students). It is really complete and full of options for task annotation and 
          sprint planning. The main challenge was taking the time to discover all the features of the tool and how to use them properly. In the end, we managed to make the most of it and 
          the planning for the SOA project was respected. It is also important to note that we also used the Agile method for our Innovative Project during all semester, using Trello to manage
          tickets and tasks. However, this was not taken into account into this course.

        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-7">
            <p>Before diving into the classical analysis of the module, I decided to use this data-focused 
              class as a way to illustrate some metrics about my semester in 5ISS.
            </p>
            <p> For this, I recorded 
              data about quantifiable metrics from my work from October 2019 to January 2020. The idea was to be able 
              to visualize the work accomplished over a long period, in a lot of different contexts, both technically 
              and in its form. It is pretty easy to get lost and overwhelmed by all the tasks and deadlines that start 
              to add up at the end of the semester, so this was also a way for me to keep track of everything and be able 
              to plan accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>The first metric I recorded was the amount of deliverables that are demanded by ISS. To this day 
              (January 17, 2020), there have been <b>31 deliverables</b>, meaning reports, slides/presentations or websites.
            </p>

        <p>This represents a lot of personal work, and we can see that some modules clearly overtake the rest: <b>Communication & Humanity</b>.</p>
        <p>It is pretty easy to explain for Humanity, as it is a Human Sciences module that typically heavily relies on presentations and reports 
          as a deliverable for evaluation. However, I think the amount of deliverables expected for Communication was really too much, especially 
          considering that this module almost entirely takes place during the three last weeks of January.
        </p>
        <p>This rush at the very end shows very well in the second metric I recorded. I tried to record all my personal work outside of class hours 
          for the entire semester. I started in late-november, so data from the beginning is not really accurate but I feel like it stays close to 
          reality. 
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3">We can really see that the end of the semester was really demanding in terms of personal work. I ended up having to work extensively during 
          almost the entire christmas vacation, mostly working on this portfolio. This may be due to poor planning from my part, but I feel that the flow 
          of modules makes it so that too many modules have deadlines around late-december of mid-january, which creates a real rush. I also spent a lot of 
          time on the portfolio, I believe more than average, and I feel like this time is not really rewarded by how much other types of evaluations are 
          present. I joined ISS believing that the portfolio would be the main evaluation method, and after seeing that every single class had its specific 
          method of validation different than the portfolio (with the exception of the Smart Devices module), it felt discouraging to spend so much time in it.

            <p>This module had very separate classes involving different skillsets. It was very oriented towards skills I already acquired in my fourth year 
              in IR-I, so it was a way for me to confirm and reinforce some skills, while acquiring new ones.
            </p>
            <p>For the <b>Processing Semantic Data</b> skillset, most of the requirements were already met in last year's class or with the general IR formation. The main new 
            thing that I appreciated today was to actually use Semantic Web to enrich real-life sensor data, something that I did not have the chance to do last year.</p>
            <p>For the <b>Data Processing and Analysis: Big Data</b> class, I really invested myself in learning the R language as a new tool for data analysis. With the 
              experience I had with the Pandas Python library, it was a pretty easy process to learn the specific techniques of dataframe manipulation. However, I do not 
              feel that I had enough time to master completely the possibilities regarding datasets and how to eploit them, while still getting to an acceptable level.</p>
            <p>For <b>Software Engineering</b>, I already knew most of the methods introduced and had a lot of experience with the Agile method. My INSA training and professional 
              experience helped reach all the requirements.</p>

        <h4>General review and feedback on the course</h4> 
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p class="mb-3">This course was constituted of three classes that did not have much in common, especially the Software Engineering class which was 
          linked to a project outside of this module, Service Oriented Architecture. There were not many links between the classes, so I find it 
          best to analyse each class separately.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">The semantic web for IoT class was pretty short and did not go too deep into the technical concepts. It is to be expected in ISS, but maybe IR-I students could 
          have been dispensed at least for the lecture and first lab, as it was done for AE students in the Energy for IoT class. Having seen most of the material last year, 
          I wish we would have gone further with maybe more hours put into the class, or its integration in one of the projects (like SOA for example). However, despite the 
          duration of the class, the difficulty of the second lab seemed really too much for non IR-I students, and I found myself spending the majority of my time helping others 
          who were having a hard time with Java programming. Maybe it would be a good idea to split the laboratory and give more guidance in it, as there were only a few lines of instructions.
          Overall, I still enjoyed the class because of my affinity to the subject, but I wish I could have done more in it.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">The big data class felt refreshing, trying to teach the concepts and practices in a fun and non-formal way. After the lectures, the tutorials were well-guided and I 
          appreciated that we were given space to look for solutions ourselves and take our time. The only grip I have would be the project, where we did not have any time associated with it in our 
          schedule, so we had to work on it entirely on our free time. Fortunately, the project was pretty small, but we still had to rush it a little bit during the christmas vacation, which took 
          away the possible maximum implication we could hacve gotten. Adding maybe 2 hours at the start for brainstorming and conception would have been a nice addition.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          As for the Software Engineering class, its placement in this module rather than the SOA module it is associated to is strange but purely administrative and does not bother anything. However, 
          as its objective was to validate our application of the Agile method, I did not like that we were forced to apply it to the Service Oriented Architecture project. Indeed, the project was done in 
          group of two or three students, which, even though is enough to use the method, is not ideal. In my case, I used the method in a group over a four month project for our main ISS project, 
          and I would have very much preferred to validate this class through it.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, this module reinforced my knowledge in Semantic Web technologies while building new skills in Big data analysis. While perfectible, the classes were interesting and easy 
          to follow, at least for me as an IR student.
