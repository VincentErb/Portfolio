        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p>The main project of this module was the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) project. It had a really interesting premise, because it aimed 
          to bring together the skills learned in both the SOA and OM2M classes into one big project.
        </p>
        <p>The objective for the project was to create a simulation of smart room management for INSA buildings. With IoT and 5G coming along, buildings 
          start to include sensors and actuators that control many of the appliances present in the rooms. What we had to do was think of sensors and actuators 
          that would be relevent in a classroom, and then create scenarios where we would pilot these devices.
        </p>
      
        <div class="row mb-4">
          <div class="col-lg-4 mt-4">
            <p>The idea was to create Web services that would perform some key actions on our sensors or actuators. We chose to implement windows and lamps actuators, 
              along with gas, light and temperature sensors. For each device, we associated a service, which would do key operations: get the device state or value, and 
              act on it in the case of actuators.
            </p>
            <p>The different Web services were controlled by a main entity, called the Controller. It was in charge of implementing the scenarios, meaning that it would 
              check the value of a certain sensor by calling its service and then would activate a light or window in response.
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we could not actually use real-life sensors or actuators. This is where OM2M comes in, because we used it to simulate sensors, by creating 
              Applicartion Entities and manually populating them with Content Instances.
            </p>

          </div>

        </div>

        <p>A web user interface was also developped to monitor and act directly on the devices of the system. It is a way for the administrator of the building to watch 
          if any part is malfunctioning, or if some threshold values (for example max temperature at which we open the windows) need to be changed. In the context of 
          the project, we could also directly put the value of a certain sensor or actuator, by sending a direct request to OM2M. It is by using this that we could 
          verify that the scenarios were indeed working and that changing the value of a sensor above a fixed threshold triggered an actuator.

        <p>It is important to note that this project was linked to the <b>Software Engineering</b> class, present in the data analysis module. Indeed, we did this project 
          following the Agile method, with three sprints of three weeks followed by a team of three students. It is a bit of an extreme case of Agile method practise, 
          but we still were able to use powerful management tools thanks to it. You can find detailed explanation 
        of this part in the descriptive part of the data analysis module by clicking on <a href="./data.html#desc">this link</a>. </p>

        <h4>Middleware for IoT</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p class="mb-0">The middleware class had its main technical challenges during the laboratories that preceded the SOA project. 
          These labs were design to have us practice with the OM2M platform on real-life examples, and even with real devices. The 
          main difficulty was understanding the nomenclature and the specificities of the OM2M standard. There is not a lot of documentation 
          online yet, as the standard is pretty recent, so it was complicated to fully understand how OM2M functionned and what it could do.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks to the explanations of our lab tutors and a lot of exchange between peers, I was able to understand the platform well and use 
          it accordingly.
        </p>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-size: smaller;"><b>Fully functioning LoRa module for our sensor</b></p>
        </div> 

        <p>There were four labs, but the main difficulty appeared in the third and fourth labs. In them, we were tasked to input real sensors and 
          smart lights, a Philips Hue connected bulb and a Fibraro light sensor in our case. As you can see on the preceding schematic, our task 
          was to use OM2M as the middleware which would get light intensity data and act on the Philips Hue accordingly. We also used the node-red 
          tool, a really useful graphic API software which also proved useful in the <a href="./smartdevices.html#mosh">Smart Devices</a> module.

        <h4>Service Oriented Architecture</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />
        <p>The technical challenges of SOA were mainly present in the project, but it mostly came from the many different technologies that the class 
          had us manipulate even before the project started, with a lot of tutorials. The main idea was to be able to create and deploy Web services, 
          but there exists many different frameworks to do that: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-2" style="font-size: 15px;"><b>SOAP: </b>it is probably the techonolgy we looked at the most during the lectures and the tutorials. The technical difficulty with it 
            was mainly that it is a pretty ageing technology, so we were faced with a lot of compatibility problems to run it smoothly. We were using a 
            downgraded version of Eclipse and still had some issues to run servers correctly. </li>
          <li class="mb-2" style="font-size: 15px;"><b>BPEL: </b> we did not view a lot of BPEL during the tutorials, but it is still worth mentionning. It is a graphical tool, 
            which allows to design and create Web services and more importantly to orchestrate the communication between different Web services. It seemed to be 
            pretty powerful, however there was a steep learning curve and it did not feel that it made the process easier than managing services in a more classical textual way.</li>
          <li class="mb-2" style="font-size: 15px;"><b>REST: </b>probably the most popular standard to build APIs and Web services, we used REST in the context of Java, using the Jersey 
            library. It is a pretty familiar library, however the main technical challenges here came from the fact that it is pretty uncommon to use Java and Jersey for big projects 
            involving many services. It is hard to juggle between java projects and work collaboratively with a team.</li>
          <li class="mb-2" style="font-size: 15px;"><b>Microservices with Spring Boot: </b>this is a framework that was covered during the last two tutorials, at about the same time that we 
            started the SOA project. It helps with creating simple Web services and deploy them very easily. However, I chose not to focus on this technology and use the 
            more widely used REST instead. Here, the technicak challenge might have been not using Spring Boot and have more difficulty with rest. I still managed to reach my 
            objectives with REST, fortunately.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Cloud & Autonomic management</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <div class="row">

            <img src="../assets/img/openstack.PNG" alt="Architecture of the project">
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: smaller;"><b>Topology of Openstack virtual network</b></p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p class="mt-3">The Cloud and Autonomic management class consisted of only two lectures, directly followed by five laboratories that 
              were really important. We studied mainly two elements: hosted virtual machines and containers using VirtualBox, and bare virtual machines using the Openstack platform. </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="mb-2" style="font-size: 15px;"><b>VirtualBox & Docker: </b>The first technology we experimented was VirtualBox. I already used it to create Linux virtual machines on my 
                  Windows laptop, to use Linux-only applications. Using it for this lab was a pretty similar process, but it is what we did with it that was different and challenging. We started two 
                  VMs and started two containers on them using Docker. We tested the main operations on containers, mainly the creation of images and takins snapshots. We saw that containers are really 
                  useful to deploy large scale applications that run over multiple servers who all need the same OS and same configuration.</li>
                <li class="mb-2" style="font-size: 15px;">
                  <b>Openstack: </b>Next, we used a different technology to study its different characteristics: Openstack. It is a bare hosted virtual machine service, meaning that it provides VMs 
                  that are running directly on the server's hardware, and you can administrate them through a web interface. Openstack also allows for Network virtualization, and it was the biggest challenge
                  for me. As you can see on the adjacent image, we created complex network topologies with wirtual sub local networks, routers and virtual machines. It was really interesting to change routes 
                  between virtual networks and see connectivity between machines that were not on a physical network but on a virtual one. We had to use this method to set up a calculator application, 
                  with the front-end of the app accessible from the outside world on a public network, and then all the back-end services hidden in an other local network, linked with a virtual gateway.

            <p>The middleware & service module was the most oriented towards skills of IR students. Consequently, the expected level for all skills in 
              the maxtrix is the maximum, mastery level. 
            </p>
            <p>The <b>Service Oriented Architecture</b> class was the biggest of them all, with a lot of tutorials and then a big, time-consuming project. 
              I already had experience with Web services in REST in my summer internship, and I am very fond of Java, which I practice at INSA and for 
              personal projects. These two elements made it possible for me to understand and master all the technical skills of the class. The concepts 
              presentend that I did not know about were clear and well-documented online, so I feel like I will retain these skills and be able to reuse them 
              easily in my career.
            <p>The <b>Middleware for Internet of Things</b> class was different, in that I did not know anything about it specifically prior to the class. However, 
              I still knew of HTTP REST requests, which was a huge help since OM2M offers to use REST as its main API. I feel like during the labs, and especially 
              during the project where I was the one in charge of OM2M, I really learned how to use and master the platform.
            </p>
            <p>As for the <b>Cloud & Autonomic computing</b> class, it was pretty disconnected from the other two, while still having a lot of technical similarities. 
              Most of the teaching was learning of theoretical concepts that I partially knew from computer culture, and I feel like the five lab sessions were enough 
              for me to take in the main skills of the class.</p>

        <h4>General review and feedback on the course</h4> 

        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p>This module was pretty interesting because it contained two classes, SOA and OM2M, that work really well together and really benefit from sharing 
          a common project. Similarly to the Smart Devices module, you can really how the skills learned in one class matter and are directly use in the other. 
          Sadly, the Cloud management class, which could have also benefitted from being linked to the other two, took place months after the others, and felt 
          pretty disconnected from everything else. I assume this is because of timetable issues trying to fit all the classes, or mayne keeing the cloud class 
          next to communication classes for the Network virtualization part, but I think I would have really enjoyed an even bigger project regrouping the three 
          classes.
        </p>

        <p>I really liked how the three classes were pretty different in overall content, but still echoed each other a lot, relying on the same core concepts, mainly Web 
          services and server constraints and problematics. It did not feel like repetition, and really made me get comfortable with the theoretical concepts and 
          technologies we used.
        </p>

        <p>On a personal level, maybe because of my background in IR and with my internship, I really liked the big project we had for SOA. It was heavily 
          criticized by some of my peers, but to me personally it was the kind of large scale project that really allows to see the power of a technology and 
          why it is used so widely in the industry. It is often hard to really illustrate technologies and framework in a limited lab environment, but I feel 
          like it succeeded here.  
        </p>

        <p>I think that overall, merging the OM2M labs with the SOA project would have been really cool, as a way to implement real sensors and actuators into our project,
          and not just some simulated ones. It would also add more tutored hours for the project, as it had to be widely done on our free time and some maybe did not get 
          prepared enough for the specific technical targets of the project. 
        </p>
        
        <p>This was also the opportunity for me to work on a project with a lot of autonomy for team and time management. I was really invested in the project, and 
          was happy to put in hours to work on it and see the results at the end.
