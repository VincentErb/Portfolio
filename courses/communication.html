        <h4>Experimentation with Software Defined Radio</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-5">
            <p class="mb-2">The main experience I retained from this module is also the first one we encountered. Before having any theoretical lectures about protocols, 
              wireless modulation, or constraints for IoT, we jumped into this series of labs that focused on Softare Defined Radios (abbreviated SDR).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">The point of SDR is to replace the use of hardware components for frequency shift, demodulation, and other key operations to receive 
              a FM signal. All these tasks are made by a single device, and all the decoding part of the signal is done through software.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              In the three labs, we first looked at the theory behind decoding a FM signal, and then used Gnuradio, a well-known tool for SDR, to exploit 
              an incoming radio signal.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">The idea was to take as input a real music radio signal (actually, it was not live radio signal but rather a previously recorded sample) and 
              try to get the audio from the source.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-7">

            </div> 
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>To do so, we implemented different treatment elements, like a frequency shifter, band-pass filters to deal with noise, or even frequency demodulators. 
          Everything is done through software, by inputting the correct parameters and variables for pre-defined Gnuradio blocks that you just have to link together 
          in the correct way to decode the signal. 
        </p>
        <p>After multiple treatment steps, we were able to retrieve a clean audio signal that we could listen to.</p>

        <p>As two classes fom this module were purely informative lectures: Energy for IoT & Security in IoT, I decided to not include
          them in this technical part, as it was difficult for me to find good technical challenges to write about them. </p>

        <h4>Protocols for connected objects</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p>There were a lot of assignments and deliverables in the protocols for connected objects: we conducted a deep study of the MAC 
          layer options for IoT, I presented a research presentation about the conflict between Donald Trump and Huawai over the Android Operating 
          System, but I chose to retain an assignment that also made me reasearch security for IoT, as I would not be mentionning the problematic 
          here otherwise, and it feels like a really important one to me.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">

            <p class="mt-3">
              As part of a group of three students, I had to conduct a deep study of the Zigbee protocol. The idea was that the whole class would present different 
              protocols, notably Zigbee, BLE, Sigfox, Lora and NB-IoT, and then we would do a big comparison on these to try and sort them in different categories. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This task was challenging for me, because I do not really have a huge affinity and ease with communication and networking. However, there are 
              a lot of resources available online that help to understand the core concepts of the standard, but also some deeper constraints like energy consumption 
              or security details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking of security, I was in charge of this subject for the presentation. I had to explain in a simple, understandable way, the complex 
              concepts of cryptography or symmetric-based key authentification, but also some network security notions that I was less at-ease with. In the 
              end, watching the presentation of other protocols helped me understand the one I was working on a bit more, as there are a lot of similarities that make 
              the choices made by one standard easier to understand and identify.

        <h4>Digital wireless communication for connected objects</h4>

              The assignment and technical difficulty of the Wireless communicaton class felt pretty similar to the previous one. After 
              folling the six lectures on the topic, we had to conduct a quick study followed by a report on one of two protocols: Sigfox 
              or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). I chose to work on Sigfox with my group. We mainly studied wireless communication problematics, 
              such as modulation, range of emission or datarate.
            </p>
            <p>It was difficult to find some of the information we were looking for. For certain elements, the official Sigfox documentation 
              was really clear and helped us understand clearly what the protocol was offering. However, when we had to find some key characteristics
              such as a precise value of the radio range in a real environment, we had to do a lot of research and ended up estimating it ourselves using 
              modelisation laws.

        <h4>Emerging networks</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />
        <p>The Emerging networks class was the only class apart from SDR that proposed laboratories in this module. The theme of the class was mostly 
          to present and explain how Software Defined Networks (SDN) worked and have us manipulate them. During the lab, the challenge was to actually use 
          SDN technologies, notably Openflow switchs. It consisted in using a networking application that would dynamically and automatically write rules in switches 
          routing tables depending on the topology of the network, its current state and the traffic going through nodes.
        </p>
        <p>There was also a real technical challenge during the last two lecture sessions, where we had to study a scientific paper about a protocol implementing 
          SDN over the 6LoWPAN technology. It was really technical, going deep in the functioning and different functionalities of the protocol, but I feel that the 
          work previously accomplished during the lectures and the labs helped me understand it well enough.

        <p id="analy">We had to write a report about this article, however the deadline for this assignment is later than the one of this portfolio, so I am unable to add it 
          to this page at the moment. It may be added after it is delivered depending on INSA politics on deliverables.

                  <li><b>1: AP</b> - level of application: follow-up of instructions or procedures </li>

                  <li><b>3: M</b> - level of proficiency: program design or specification definitions</li>
                  <li><b>4: EX</b> - level of expertise: definition of orientations or strategies</li>

            <p>As I expressed in the previous sections, the Communication module was really dense. It contained a lot of classes, with a huge amount of 
              information and assignments. The skills in the matrix are separated into two sub-sections, and the first one of the two is heavily loaded,
              which represents well the amount that was presented and needed to be acquired in the few weeks that this module took place in.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the <b>Protocols of communication</b> classes, I feel like I reached the expected level, but did not have enough time to go over it and 
              reach a comfortable level in all subjects presented. Having already had quite a lot of network classes in third and fourth year at INSA, I feel 
              like my previous training prepared me quite well to the classes. I feel like I really understand the current state of IoT standards, the direction 
              where they are going and how the domain is going to evolve in the upcoming years. I felt a little bit less at ease with purely techincal skills, wether 
              they are energy constraints, or complex RF reception techniques. However, I think that almost all students except those who followed Network and Communication 
              in fourth year were in the same situation than I was in, so a lot of peer exchance made it possible for everyone to understand the main concepts approached.
          </p>
            <p>
              As for the <b>Security for IoT</b> class, it focused on a subject that I really like and research on my own personal free-time, so I had no real difficulty 
              understanding the main concepts. Also, I think that the class, with only 6 lectures staying at a relatively surface level, did not go as far as it was maybe 
              intended, so it can be harder tu judge the skills acquired during the lectures. Overall, I think that the initial training, along with my previous knowledge, 
              helped me reach the required level.

        <h4>General review and feedback on the course</h4>

       <p>
         Overall, this course was the last one of the year for me and everyone else. It came at the very end of the semester, where we were already 
         rushed by projects and deliverables deadlines. So, it was not the best environment to start a new class, and I feel like maybe it missed the mark 
         on some points for me. The chosen way of teaching was through student presentations. This was really interesting because it is pretty rare to use 
         the tecnique that much in such a technical module. As we've discussed in the <a href="./data.html#datanalysis">data analysis of ISS</a>, there were 8 deliverables
         on the form of reports and presentations. This was a lot, and at this late time period, I believe too much for me and the other students to fully 
         invest in them.
       </p>
       <p>Indeed, I had the feeling that I had to rush most assignments, and maybe not spend as much time as needed to fully understand the concepts and technologies 
         that I was studying.
       </p>
       <p>Along with that, the Energy and Security classes felt disconnected from the rest, being just isolated lectures that did not resonate with everything else. I 
         know the schedule of ISS is pretty full already, but I feel like adding tutorials or laboratories, at least for the security class, would be a huge improvement 
         for the class.
       </p>
       <p>
         Still, what I really enjoyed about this module is that it approached IoT through a variety of angles, both technical and non-techincals, to give us a clear 
         and pretty exhaustive picture of the state of Internet of Thing today. Prior to this module, I did not have a clear understanding and knowledge of IoT, its possibilites and 
         limitations. Even if we did not go too far in technical details for some domains, I still retained a lot of information that will be critical to stay on par with the 
         evolution of the industry in the upcoming years.
       </p>
       <p>
         I did not choose ISS because of its focus on IoT, to be frank I was pretty indifferent about the domain before going into this module. However, we have seen a lot of 
         possibilities that the domain seems to offer for the future, and it is pretty fascinating to explore all the possible outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
         Now, I am really excited to go to Mobile World Congress in February after winning the Hackaton, as I will be able to see actual implementations of all the great ideas we have 
         discussed during this module.
