            values measurement. Then, we tackled the actual sensor creation at the AIME lab, and all the post treatment of the 
            measurement produced.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">The first experience we had in the Smart Devices module was the internship in the <b>AIME cleanroom</b>. It lasted for a week, 
        consisting in different half-day modules where we could oversee and manipulate the different processes involved in the manufacturing of a nano-particle sensor. 
        The end goal was to make a gas sensor from Tungsten nano-particles, that expresses a variation of resistance when detecting specific gases (in our case Ethanol & Ammonia). </p>

            <p class="mb-3">The different steps we followed to make the sensor were the following: <span class="badge badge-warning ml-2">Technical</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li class="mb-2"><b>Exposing the sensor circuit by photolithography: </b> without going into too much detail about the process of photolithography, 
              we used it to engrave based on a mask on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wafer_(electronics)">silicium wafer</a>. As you can see on the adjacent picture, it is a pretty complex 
              mask containing a heating resistance, a temperature sensor, and two interdigitated combs where we will make the deposition.</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><b>Making and deposing the nano-particles: </b> the next step was to create the Tungstene nano-particles and deposit them 
              on the engraved wafer. To do so, we followed an extremely precise chemical process, using pipettes going to a 0.05 milliliter precision. <br> 
              Once we obtained the particles, we deposited them using a process called 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dielectrophoresis">Dielectrophoresis</a>. What we did was we put a drop of our very diluted
              solution containing the nano-particles on the entire sensor circuit, and then put an electrical field only on the intergititated combs part. 
              This resulsted in the particles only "sticking" to the desired part when we rinced the solution in water. </li>
              <li class="mb-2"><b>Caraterising the sensor for the datasheet: </b> now that we had our sensor, we tried to caracterise it by generating some I/V curves,
              so that all the groups could use their data to create a datasheet.</li>

        <p class="mt-3">Once the AIME internship was finished for all the groups, we gathered the data from all the sensors created by the students to obtain
          a good database for the datasheet. Using the concepts we learned during the "Introduction to sensors" class, we were able to redact a datasheet 
        that tries to be as close as possible to the ones you can find in the industry, made by professional mnufacturers. <br>
        You can find the datasheet made by my group in the link below: </p>

        <p>Once we successfully build our gas sensor, we could start the main part of this course. We had a lot of freedom, as we could choose between following 
          directed labs, or starting a mini-project directly related to our gas sensor. With my computer science background, I hesitated going for this electronics-heavy
          project, but I teamed up with a friend from AE and TBS and decided to do it.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <div class="mt-3 pt-2">
              <img class="testshadow" src="../assets/img/miniproject.jpg" alt="Mini project results">
              <p class="mt-3" style="text-align: center; font-size: smaller;"><b>Fully functioning LoRa module for our sensor</b></p>
            </div> 
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p class="pt-3 mt-1 mb-3">What we did was we built a processing circuit for our sensor, mainly using an Arduino Uno. The output of our sensor 
              is a variation of resistance, so we used the <b>KiCad</b> software to design a PCB to convert it to a tension variation. We implemented the 
              analog circuit we created during the Analog Electronics labs. </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Then, we created an interrupt-based system to have the Arduino send a LoRa packet only when the sensor value exceeds a certain threshold. 
                This was done by using a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Schmitt_trigger">Schmitt trigger</a> to send a 0 or a 1 depending on if we are below 
                or above the threshold. We would then use this signal as input into the digital port 2 or 3 of the Arduino Uno we used, triggering an interrupt when 
                we needed it.
            </p>
            <p>With all that done, we only needed to send the LoRa message and we would be good to go. To do so, we used a RN2483 LoRa chip, that we welded ourselves. 
              Once it was ready to use, we tried to send data to The Things Network using the antenna on the roof of the GEI, and got successful results. We were  then able 
              to vizualise our data in the cloud on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/">The Things Network</a>. <br> To improve the use of our data, we used 
              the <a target="_blank" href="https://nodered.org/">Node-red</a> to help us create a dashboard where we could exploit the data and visualize it in an appealing way.

        <h4>Microcontroller and Open Source Hardware (MOSH)</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p class="mb-2">Because it involved many different skillsets, the MOSH mini-project had different challenges: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-2">First off, we had to weld the <b>RN2483 LoRa chip</b> we wanted to use, and no one in the group had much experience in that aspect. It required some trial and error, as 
            the tools at our disposal were not optimal for precision welding, but we got a hang of it eventually and managed to weld the chip.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">We had to get used to using an Arduino and especially an <b>Arduino Uno</b>, as no one in the group had experience with it either. Fortunately for us, there is 
            a lot of documentation online that goes over the main concepts of programming on Arduino, and we were even able to find examples of code for LoRa communication, 
            which helped us accelerate the process a lot. We then had to connect the RN2483 to our Arduino, which even though it seems easy, took us a lot of time because we 
            had some issues with connecting the wrong pins and it was really time consuming to realize that.
          </li>
          <li>The project also involved some Electronics notion which we had not practised for a while, even though they are pretty basic. 
            We implemented a non-inverser <b>Schmitt Trigger</b> using a LTC1050 Operational Amplifier. We needed to convert an analogical value ranging from 1V to 5V to 
            a digital 0 or 1 if the analogical value exceeds a certain threshold. We chose a Schmitt Trigger over a simpler Comparator circuit 
            because it works better with oscillation of the analog signal, and the gas sensor behave with a lot of oscillations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Analog electronics labs</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p>The Analog electronics labs were here to help us design the analog signal treatment part to exploit the values coming from our gas 
          sensor. As said previously, the sensor's output is a resistance variation, which can be expressed as a current variation by imposing 
        V (the tension). However, this current is really small, at about 100 nA, and we cannot measure it directly. So,  we had to create 
        a signal processing circuit to move the signal in a tension 1.1V to 5V, which corresponds to the range of the ADC of the Arduino Uno. </p>
        <p>Designing the circuit was pretty challenging, involving signal processing notions and filters that we had not used in a long time. 
          Fortunately, we used the tool <b>LTSpice</b>, an electronics circuits simulator, to help us iterate over prototypes and test our results.
        </p>

        <h4>CAD, manufacturing and integration of nano-technology sensors</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>Once we had followed the Analog Electronics labs, this class was here to help us design a shield for Arduino Uno, implementing 
              the circuit we created before. Timing issues made so that we had to start this process before having the circuits designed, so 
              part of it was handed out to us so we could begin. <br> The main challenge here was to get used to the PCB editing software <b>KiCad</b>, 
              which is a pretty complex and complete tool that takes a while to get used to. There are different steps in the process of designing 
              a PCB: creating the footprints, linking the components, but the most challenging is the routing. <br>
              Routing consists in placing every component you wish to have on your shield in a limited space without any wires crossing. It was a 
              pretty big challenge to try and place everything in the best way possible to avoid wire crosses as much as possible. Fortunately, we had 
              at our disposal components like "vias" that helped us cross sometimes in certain conditions. <br>
              In the end, we submitted our KiCad PCB proposal to all the students, so that the best ones could be elected and printed. However, do to a 
              timing error, it was not possible to print the PCBs this year.

        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p>I chose to group the technical challenges of the last two classes together, because they served a similar purpose. In the 
          introduction to sensors class, we had some theoretical lectures about the general physics principles of sensors, along with 
          some physics practicals that brought back notions that we had not used for three years. It also gave us critical notions on 
          how to design a good datasheet, what metrics to use, what errors to <span id="analy">avoid.</span>  
        </p>
        <p>The Optical sensors class was supposed to be similar, with a few theoretical lectures going deeper into the specificities 
          of laser-based sensors. Unfortunately, it was cancelled after one session because of low student attendance.

            <p>The smart devices module was probably the course that required the widest array of technical skills from this year. Also, 
              it was one of the least oriented towars software skills, relying more on electronics, signal processing and physics knowledge.  
              Understandably, the requirements for my IR profile were a bit lower than in other classes. However, I still feel that I acquired the 
              required skills and in some parts, maybe more.
            </p>
            <p>For the <b>Introduction to sensors</b> class, my physics and chemistry background from the first, more general years at INSA 
            really helped me to alleviate any potential struggle. The initial formation was enough for me to follow the requirements. As for the 
            datasheet redaction, I feel that working in a group of 9 people where we exchanged a lot of ideas made me reach a level of expertise 
            that is above what I expected at first.</p>
            <p>As for the <b>Microcontroller and Open-Source Hardware</b> project, I felt really invested because microcontrollers and low-level 
            applications are a domain that I really like. I already had some skills from previous INSA projects or personal projects on Raspberry Pi 
            for example, so it was easy for me to translate these experiences and use them for this project. I would say the KiCad PCB conception was 
            quite difficult to master as first and the analog acquisition circuit involved notions that were a little bit far away in my memory,
             but eventually I got the results I expected.</p>

            <p>Overall, this course if one of my favourites of the year, mainly because it was the chance to follow the entire process 
              of creation of a sensor, from nano-particle deposition to analog circuit or PCB designing and finally LoRa communication. 
              To me, it is the course that encaptures the spirit of ISS the most, and I really felt that I was acquiring a really wide 
              array of skills, and even more being with peers having a different background than mine. I also really liked the level of 
              freedom I had and how adapted the class seemed to be for every background. Notably, the ability to choose to go for a long 
              project if we felt confident, or going through more guided laboratories if we were not was a really good idea. In retrospect, 
              I'm really happy to have chosen the project, despite my computer science background, and having to decide and show confidence 
              to choose it really is a bonus.</p>
            <p>I also really liked and benefited from all the complementary classes to the main project directly helping with everything. In most 
              other courses, the classes are pretty disconnected from each other and we sometimes can't make the link as to why these classes are 
              put together in the first place. In this module, I really felt like every class was useful to me in the realization of the required 
              projects.
            </p>
            <p>However, everything was not perfect, and the flow of the different modules coming together was a little derailed by some timing 
              issues with the placement of the classes. For example, we did not have the analogic electronic labs before starting to design our PCB
              which was directly based on the circuits we would develop in the labs. We ended by simply copying a circuit that was given to us. Also, the KiCad PCBS presentations occured too late in the semester 
              for INSA to manufacture them, so we did not get the chance to use the LoRa module we developped with the sensor we created, and used 
              an already existing sensor instead. Less of a problem but still to be noted, the Optical sensors class felt a little bit disconnected 
              from everything else, even though I quite like it for scientific culture reasons.
            </p>
            <p>Despite these problems, I feel like this module was one of the ones I felt the most invested in, and I can confidently say that I have 
              learned a lot of skills that I would not have, had I chosen another orientation than ISS.
