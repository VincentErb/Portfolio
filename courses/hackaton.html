              on connected mobility, it allowed us to come up with the best innovative ideas and prototypes, and then 
              confront them to an expert jury of industrial actors.

            <p>The hackaton is supposed to be part of the Analysis and data processing, business applications module, but I feel like it was put here because it 
              had to go somewhere, and it feels like an experience that should be treated apart from the rest of the classes.</p>
            <p>Preceding the hackaton were a series of seminaries presenting different standards and technologies that would be available to us for the main event. 
              Attending to these events, especially the MangoH hands-on session, was a crucial element to help us gain time in the competition.
            </p>
            <p>It was indeed a competition. All students from ISS and some students from design school, making about 75 people, formed teams of about 5 students to 
              compete and win the first prize: a trip to Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress. It is a world renown event for technologies of communication, and 
              goind there constitutes a major career opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>The theme of the contest was: <b>Connected Mobility</b>. A very large subject that would leave the room open for a lot of ideas. We had two days to present 
            a 5 minute pitch and a 5 minute demonstration to a jury of industrials. I constituted a team with friends from ISS and a student from Toulouse School of Design. 
          We decided to call ourselves <b>The Spaghet'team</b>.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p class="pt-2 mb-2">The very first step that we had to tackle was the probably the most important but also had to be completed very fast: we had to find an idea. 
              It all came pretty naturally, as a discussion a few days prior to the event sparked an idea in our heads to do something linking the practice of a bycicle with 
              listening to music. Pretty quickly, we started thinking about the idea in a more concrete way, and the entire team was directly convinced by it. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">With our prototype, 
              we wanted to <b>synchronize the tempo of the music you're listening to to your pedaling pace</b>. Now that we figured our what we wanted to do, we could get to work 
              on the technical development of the prototype. </p>
            <p class="mb-2">Before going any further, I think it is important to present the members of the team, and what their skillset was for the 
              project. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Philippe: coming from IR like me, but specialized in networks. Will work with me on the business part of the code and work on MangoH</li>
              <li>Marine: coming from AE (Electronics), works well on microcontroller and electronics problematics</li>
              <li>Lucie: GP (Physics) student, good with sensors and microcontollers. She and Marine will work on sensors, Arduino and sending data to the MangoH</li>
              <li>Ambre: Design student, will help us with concept drawings, presentation graphics, product design</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <div class="mt-3 mb-2">
              <iframe width="100%" height="500px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YbvPM49mMHo" 
              frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p class="mb-2">To get into more details about our solution, we had two key separate aspects we had to get right: <b>how to get the pedaling frequency/pace</b>, and <b>
          how to adjust the tempo of the music given a specific tempo.</b> Marine and Lucie, with their sensor & electronics background, were focused on the pedaling part. 
          Even though I did not work very much on this part, I feel it is important to present it. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">At first, they thought of going with an infrared emittor/receptor. You put the 
          receptor on the bike frame, and the emittor on the pedal. When the pedal comes in front of the frame after one cycle, we detect infrared light. However, we quickly dropped the 
          idea because it did not seem too stable especially when it rains or it is foggy. We thought of a better, even more compact idea, by using a <b>Hall effect sensor.</b>
         With this solution, you only need to put a magnet on the pedal, and then the sensor on the bike frame. Magnets can be really small and already stick to a bike pedal made 
        from aluminium, so it is a compact, practical solution that gave really good detection results.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 pt-2">Now, we had to send the pedaling data to the cloud through the mangoH, and then exploit it to play some music with a tempo corresponding to the 
          pedaling frequency. This part came with a lot of technical and practical questions, but we will get into detail about them in 
          the <a href="#tech">Technical part</a>. After two days, our prototype was working and it was time to pitch it and demonstrate it.

        <p>On December 6th at about 3 PM, all the teams stopped working on the project, it was time to present what we did for the past two days. 
          Every group went in front of the jury for a 5 minute pitch followed by a 5 minute demonstration. The team decided that me and Lucie should 
          present in French, to make the presentation as lively as possible. We presented the prototype as a startup product, creating a brand identity with 
          a name: <br> 
          <b>Ride Your Vibes</b> and a company iconography.

        <p class="mt-2">After our successful pitch, we conducted our demonstration that went really well too. The jury deliberated for 
          a pretty long time, started by announcing the third place team, second place, and then ... <b>The Spaghet'team !</b>.
        </p>

        <p>We're really happy and excited to be able to go to Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress. It is a big opportunity for me 
          and all the members of the team. The trip will be on February 25th to 26th, and this page will be updated with pictures of 
          our trip after the event.

        <p class="mb-2">As the hackaton was a very short event, there were no big technical challenges, but a lot 
          of small issues we had to deal with quickly. I am going to list them and explain quickly how we dealt with them: 
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="mb-2"><b>Handle cloud communication of sensor data using MangoH:</b> I am pretty certain that I will not be the only one to complain about 
            this part, but getting the hang of how to use the MangoH properly certainly was time-consuming. What we wanted to do with it was pretty 
            simple, we simply wanted to send the sensor data received (just an ACK everytime the sensor picks up the magnet signal) to a cloud based server 
            where we would do all the processing. We chose this architecture in order to lighten the load on the sensor/microcontroller on the bike, 
            maximizing battery life. Due to firmware issues and lack of documentation, it took us a long time to get it to work, but thanks to the help 
            of the Sierra Wireless representative, we managed to send the data.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><b>Design the main processing code: </b> As I stated just before, the only thing we received on the python server we put on was an ACK signal containing 
            the timestamp of dispatch. That means that we calculated the pedaling frequency from the server, based on the timestamps between two messages. 
            Now, to have a robust functioning program, we could not stop with just recalculating the frequency and changing the music every time it changed. 
            We had to put up tendancy-based indicators, so that we would change the music only when we detect a steady change of pace for at least 15 seconds. Also, 
            if the user abruptly stops, we keep the music going as it may be due to a stopping sign or an obstacle.</li>
          <li><b>Interact with the Spotify API: </b> Now that we had the main processing figured out, we still needed to play a music at a given tempo 
            when we wanted to. We were very lucky in finding that the Spotify API calculates the tempo for all the music hosted on the platform. Knowing that, 
            we decided to use the Spotify API directly, to play music directly from a user's playlist. The way it works is you select a playlist as an input 
            (ideally with more than 50 songs to have a lot of tempo avaiable), and we will match the song that has the closest tempo to your pedaling rythm. 
            With big playlists, you can get a song at exactly the same tempo, and then you can syncrhonize your pedalling which will be motivating to keep going 
            and maintain a steady pace.</li> 
        </ul>

        <h4>Personal Review and Feedack</h4>

        <p>I may be biased do to the fact of winning it, but I feel like tha Hackaton was a really great experience for me and 
          all the other students. We were put in a fair competing environment where there was only good spirit and help between the 
          different team. I was lucky to have a team that was very invested in the event and was willing to finish at 11 PM on the 5th. 
        </p>
        <p>A rush event like this one brings up a lot of key engineer skills in my opinion. You have to be able to explain your ideas quickly 
          and clearly to your team, listen to everyone input and try to assign tasks in the more efficient way. Managing different skillsets 
          on a limited time window can be tough, but I think we did a pretty good job with it. Working long hours can also be a source of conflict 
          between team members, and it is important to avoid or manage that. 
          <br>
          On a more technical standpoint, even though we contemplated getting out of our comfort zone and trying to work on different fields than our 
          field of expertize, we realized that with so little time, we had to focus on what we were good at. I would say this was a good test to see how 
          to work under stress and time constraint without getting overwhelmed by it. I used technical points seen in the classes of ISS, like RESt requests 
          in Python, Arduino data interfacing, etc ...
        </p>
        <p>In the end, it was a real pleasure to take part in the Hackaton, me and my teammates tried to produce the best thing we could, and we are really 
          happy that it paid of and lead to a victory in the end.
        </p>
