            <p>The Innovation & Humanity module gathers the <b>six classes</b> that don't focus on technical skills but rather management, creativity 
              and human skills. We will study management, social psychology, innovation and creativity and even sports practise. We will also have 
              a professsional development class with a mockup job interview. 
              The variety of the classes makes so that some of the skills learned are directly linked to managing a project 
              as an engineer, but other apply to humans in general and how to live as a citizen in our society. </p>

            <p class=" mt-1 pt-2 mb-2">The social psychology class was certainly one of the more original classes of the year. Compared to other classes of the module where the learning 
              process was classical, with the teacher passing on information to us, here different methods were preferred. We would often do debates on a subject where the teacher 
              did not take part in it until the very end. We learned the core concepts through presentations by the students, and the only real instruction was to "not make it boring." 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">We also spent an entire 3 hours class watching the movie <b>Twelve Angry Men</b>, and then analysing it. It is about a jury of men discussing if they should 
              vote guilty or not guilty during a trial. Behind that, almost all the themes of social psychology like manipulation, social influence, prejudice were presented.
            </p>
          </div>       
        </div>

        <p class="mt-2">The main work we had to accomplish for the class was to present one of seven themes of social psychology. These presentations would 
          be the only theoretical material we would have during the class, so we had to include all the key elements while also presenting something fun and interesting.
           I decided to present the subject of Stereotypes and Prejudice.
        </p>
        <p>The main idea we had to make the presentation interactive and funny, was to play on the fact that one of the group members wars from Asian descent to have him expose 
          stereotypes about himself. He began the presentation by just stating facts about his life, that were in fact all stereotypes. In the end, we conducted a 
        debat on a subject that proved to be succesful.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6 mt-2">
            <p class="mb-2">From october 23 to 25, we went on a sports training internship in the high mountains of the Pyrenees. We stayed at the 
              Ticou Lake in Bolquère (1800m altitude). We were separated in three groups depending on physical aptitude. I chose the middle 
              group.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">During the three days, we conducted different activities. On the first day, we all competed in an orientation race.
              The goal was to find the 20 marks in as little time as possible. It was agreat race and we finished around the firsts. Then for a half-day, we went out for mountain biking, a sport I had 
              never practiced. It is a bit tough and scary at first, but when getting the hang of it, it offers great sensations. We also went 
              rock climbing. I had a lot of experience with indoor climbing, but this first time outside was really stunning. 
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the main activity was going hiking for an entire day. All the groups went to the same place: the Bouillouses Lake. I already 
              went to the spot, but it is a really big area with lots of different paths to take. We went up near the Carlit Peak, highest point of the 
              area, at 2921m. However, due to the heavy snowing a few days before, the route to the summit was not safe so we enjoyed the view a few meters below.

        <p class="mb-2">The Innovation class started with a few theoretical lectures, talking about the main concepts of innovation, project management
          and teamwork. The real challenge started after these, when the class started to get really close with our main project. What we 
          had to do was to rethink our project development and strategy taking into accounts the elements we had seen. When tasked with a project, 
          most of us jump directly to a technical solution, without paying much attention to market, user acceptability or ethics constraints. 
          We were encouraged and took time to write reports about specific issues from the class, and in the end, we had to present the taweaways 
          from these with our project. 
        </p>
        <p>We did a project presentation including the advancement at the beginning of december, risk assessment issues, our time management methods and 
          social acceptability analysis. You can watch the slides of our presentation by clicking the link below. However, if this is your first real encounter

        <h4>Creativity methods (TRIZ)</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-7">
            <p>The TRIZ class had a pretty simple premise. It consists in tutorials where we learn the key concepts of the TRIZ creativity method, 
              and then we apply them to an study object of our choice. However, it is a pretty complex and powerful method, so aplying it correctly
              was not an easy task. The object I chose to study (in a group of two along with Diep Vu) is <b>the Spoon.</b> We were asked to select 
              a simple object, because using TRIZ on a complex object is really complicated. 
            </p>
            <p>What we did to understand the TRIZ method is the following: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>First, we conducted some precise analysis of the object, by following some precise techniques which would give us key indicators about 
                our object.
              </li>
              <li>Then, we would use the analysis we made as a reading key to use the TRIZ resolution matrix. It is the main element of the method. 
                How it works is you identify a contradiction in the object (for example you want the spoon to dissolve sugar faster but you don't 
                want to put more effort in it), and then you put that contradiction in the matrix. 
              </li>
            </ul>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Applying the method gave us solution leads that we could apply to 
          find concrete idead on how to improve the spoon. In the end, one of the solutions we proposed was to have a heating spoon, that 
          would melt sugar while you are stirring so it dissolves faster in coffee. You can read the full report of our TRIZ case-study by clicking

            <p class=" mt-1 pt-2 mb-2">The main technical challenge for this class was researching and preparing our presentation. Our theme was: 
              <b>Stereotypes and Prejudice</b>. We had some key information to include so that people would at least get the key elements, but other 
              than that we were pretty free to present how we wanted to.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">My main task was to present an unknown part of the notion of stereotype. After a lot of research, I decided to go with what is 
              called <b>The stereotype threat</b>. 
            </p>
            <p>It is a theory that tries to explain partly why stereotypes tend to confirm themselves, even though 
              we are aware that they are stereotypes. I based my presentation partly of off the adjacent video. As it is done in it, I tried to explain 
              very logically with a demonstration how stereotypes lead to prejudice then discrimination, which then comes back in a positive feedback loop 
              to create a self-fullfiling prophecy. It means that being aware of being a victim of stereotype does not necessarily help you fight it.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>Team management was perhaps the most classical class of this module. It consisted in four lectures where we oversaw the main concepts of 
              team management. It is the only class of this year that had an actual test, in the form of an MCQ (QCM in French). The technical challenge 
              was to shift our way of thinking regarding working with a team on a project. Until now, we only have been equal members of a team, but pretty 
              soon in our career, we will be in a project lead position and we will have to manage a team. Between dealing with conflicts, ensuring good 
              productivity and performance and communicating your objectives to the team, even motivating people consistutes very important skills. The way 
              we acquired them during the class was by doing a lot of exercises and case studies. Studying the theoretical notions is important, but applying 
              them to real-life examples helped me a lot to get comfortable with them.

        <h4>Individual Professional Development</h4>
        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />
        <p>The Individual Professional Development module (also called PPI) has been around every year since I got into INSA. Over the years, the teaching methods 
          and form varied quite a lot, with standard lectures in first year, and small group discussions last year. In fifth year, the challenge was preparing us 
          for a job interview simulation. As all of us were going to look for our fifth year internship, we needed to do well in interviews, and the teacher I had 
          really tried to make us perform as well as we could. First, we talked a lot about techniques, good things to say and not say, subjects to put forward in 
          an interview. However for these exercises, it is always good to practice as mush as possible. I practiced in front of a mirror, judging my non-verbal mistakes 
          that are maybe more important than the things you may say. 
        </p>
        <p>I did my mockup interview with the Human Resources manager at ACTIA. I was interviewing for a real job offer, posted by another company though. It lasted 30 
          minutes and overall I was quite happy with my performance. My interviewer gave me a lot of critical feedback, and I feel like it helped me a lot. I really felt 
          more prepared for the actual job interviews I had later during the semester for my internship.

                  The skills matrix rates the skill level of a student from with 4 levels of expertise. The levels are the following:

                <ul>
                  <li><b>1: AP</b> - level of application: follow-up of instructions or procedures </li>
                  <li><b>2: AN</b> - level of analysis: improvement or optimization of solutions or proposals </li>
                  <li><b>3: M</b> - level of proficiency: program design or specification definitions</li>

                  Finally, there is the Learning mode. It describes the biggest way or ways I learned a skill, it can be:

                  <li><b>IT: </b>Initial training</li>

            <p>It is harder to specify the skills acquired in non-technical classes, and I believe all of them are not present on the skills matrix.

            </p>
            <p>For the <b>Manage an innovative project</b> skillset, these are really important skills that are hard to master only from what we learn in class. 
              I feel like my experience during my summer internship, and having a leading position in most of the student project I take part in, played 
            a major role in my mastery of these skills.</p>
            <p>I would say most of the same applies to the <b>Learning Teamwork</b> project. I feel like the Team Management and social psychology classes 
              are important to help learn this skill, but simply being with students coming from different background, cultures and countries also helped 
              me a lot.</p>
            <p>As for the <b>Be convincing: defend an idea </b> point, to me it was acquired partly the very important number of oral presentations we made this semester. 
              Sometimes, I think it is too much (it maybe is), but it sure helped me a lot with confidence when presenting my ideas to an audience. The different projects 
              of the year also complemented what we learned in Innovation and Team Management classes.</p>

        <p>Overall, the Innovation and Humanity module was probably the Human Science module I like the most of my five years at 
          INSA. My only gripe with it was that some classes felt rushed due to the limited number of hours allowed (especially the 
          social psychology class), but I understand that every class is important and it is hard to find time in our already packed 
          schedule.
        </p>
        <p>I feel like I learned a lot of skills and knowledge, and not necessarily things that only apply to an engineer. I really appreciate 
          that we have classes that leave the frame of the computer science engineer and try to teach us elements that will be useful to us 
          in our entire life.
        </p>
        <p>I felt really invested in the classes. Being at the beginning of the semester certainly helped a lot, giving us time to prepare and 
          take time to research the classes, which we often don't have to do later in the semester. Keeping the Innovation module at the 
          beginning is something I really appreciated and I hope it will remain that way in the future.
        </p>
        <p>Something that I also really like was that the Innovation class with Eric Jolivet shifted to be linked with the project more than he 
          initially intended. Indeed, he gave us some of his class time to work on advancing our main project, because he realized we did not have 
          any affected time to it in our schedule, and we were really falling behind. He had to skip some elements of his class to adjust to the lost 
          time, but overall I feel like it was the right thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, these classes felt more important to me than they have ever been. They tried to give us guidance as engineers and as humans,
           as we are ready to enter a new stage of our life with the beginning of our professional career.
        </p>
