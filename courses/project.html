              Alison, formerly called the Alison project, is a project that is very important to me, and probably what I am the most proud of this year. The history of 
              the project goes back further than 5ISS. It started back when I was in fourth year, and I chose a subject for the mandatory research project. The pitch was the following: 
            </p>
            <p><b>Build a sound recognition system for the deaf or hearing-impaired</b>, where you can recognize specific sounds of a person's home environment (like the doorbell, an alarm, the phone ringing), 
              and alert the user in a visual way, by lighting up a lightbulb in a specific color.
            </p>
            <p>I worked on the project in fourth year from October 2018 to June 2019, before leaving the project at the proof of concept state at the end of the school year. </p>
            <p>I joined 5ISS with two of my colleagues from the fourth year team, and we and our tutors felt like we had to pursue the project to bring it further, from a proof of concept 
              to a prototype that could actually be developed and shared to those who really need it. So we proposed the subject to Thierry Monteil for ISS, and built a new team to work 
              on the project during this semester.
            </p>
            <p>The objective was to go from a technical proof of concept to a real product prototype, so our focus was not purely technical anymore, but we thought of problematics of 
              design, marketing, communication or ethics as well.
            </p>
            <p>In the end, we presented a demonstration of the working prototype of Alison, and opened our project to the world by publishing documentation and source code on 
              a website. You can get more information and technical documentation directly on the website, by clicking the link below.

              There were a lot of technical challenges during the innovative project. Some were linked to hardware, setting up communication 
              with connected bulbs or between the Raspberry Pi and an Android App, ... However the biggest challenge is clearly the core of our solution: 
              the sound recognition.
            </p>
            <p>We took a pretty atypical approach, because we wanted to do sound recognition with no database and only one recording of a sound. To do so, 
              we used the NMF method. I will not explain the method in detail here, and you can find an in-depth explanation of it on the Alison website.
            </p>
            <p>The NMF method is at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning, however nobody on the team was an expert of these domains when 
              we started working on the project. What me and Maxime Arens (my peer working on NMF) did was we went and contacted Cédric Févotte, researcher at N7, 
              and ask him to explain the method to us and tell us if it is applicable to sound recognition. I don't think that we would have been able to 
              use the method successfully without his input, and this challenge was the opportunity for us to use our network to find solution to problems needing 
              outside skillsets.

            <p>The entire ISS program is provided in english, most of the classes being taught in english along with all presentations we had to make.
              It is an important part of the entire year, but it was mostly linked with the innovative project. To that end, the main challenge this year 
              linked to english was the realization of a website to promote our product: Alison. I was in charge of developing the website, so it was a software 
              challenge for me. I believe starting with the Alison website both last year and this year is what made me consider building my portfolio as a website 
              as well.  
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the english of the website, the main difficulty was writing in a style that corresponds well to startups and young projects. The idea 
              was not simply to write correct english, we also had to be enciting in our communication to generate interest around the project. 
            </p>
            <p>We also had a lot of work for the different presentations of the project we made throughout the year. While we have practised our presentation 
              skills for five years, there are still many ways that we can improve, especially in english. After presenting the final product at the end of the semester,
              I really felt like I had made progress on my presentation skills in english, having a better energy and fluidity in my speech.

        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />
        <p>Similarly to the website I had to develop for our Innovative project, the main technical challenge of this portoflio is the form I decided to give it. The main 
          challenge of course is writing the content of the portfolio, but this will be the focus of the analytical part. I chose to build a website to have a really flexible 
          portfolio, where one could navigate clearly and easily between all the pieces that are put together. There is a lot of content in this portfolio and I did not want 
          to stull 80% of the content in an appendix part at the end where no one would read it. I wanted everything to be readily available, and I am confident that 
          I succeeded with this objective.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website was realized using bootstrap 4 and a bootstrap 4 theme called Paper Kit 2. While the use of a theme certainly helped with the initial design of the 
          website, I truly believe that the changes I made to it and the decisions I made in the layout and choice of content to include really improved my web design skills. 
          It is a domain that is not really taught at INSA (understandably so because it is not always an engineer's job) but I personally really enjoy it, so I really 
          appreciated the opportunity to improve thanks to the portfolio.

              None of the skills present in this module are technical skills. Even though being an engineer in compmuter science is a mainly technical 
              jobs, I feel like the skills I acquired in this module are some of the most important of the year.

              I really invested myself into the <b>Innovative 
              Project</b>, because it is a project that I was personally involved in from last year and I really like working on it. This year, I had more of a manager 
              role, dealing with coordinating the different skillsets and tasks at hand. I feel that I really improved on my presentation and communication skills, 
              and that my enthusiasm for this project was received by others. We were able to go from a technological proof of concept of sound recognition with NMF,
              to a fully packaged product with a real client experience that worked great as a demonstration. The project is still open and we may have a partnership 
              with Toulouse city-hall to continue it moving forward. In the end, the innovative project is probably what I am the most proud of for this year.

          Speaking of things I am really proud of, the portfolio is probably close second behind the project. I have been frustrated 
          this year because I felt that we had too little time to really invest in the different deliverables we had to produce, so I knew 
          I wanted to spend time on the portfolio to make it as good as I could. I started really late, having only a rough draft at the end of 
          December. However, I knew since the end of November that I wanted to invest all my time during the christmas break in it. I made sure that 
          I ended all my other assignments to have only the portfolio to work on.
        </p>
        <p>I tried to work on the form to have something as easy and pleasant to read as possible, but also on the actual content that remains the most important 
          part of the exercise. I made the choice to only present experiences made during the 5ISS program, not including my 4th year internship (even though the poster 
          is viewable in the generalities section) or skills coming from out of INSA, like the ones acquired during my time in the Enfoiros for example. 
        </p>
        <p>To me, this was a really dense formation and I have learned way enough things to fill this portfolio with.</p>

        <h4>General review of the year</h4> 

        <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:rgb(199, 196, 192);background-color:rgb(199, 196, 192);" />

        <p>For this module, I decided not to make a specific module review but rather try to think about the year in general. The Innovative project really encapsulates 
          the biggest part of the year for me, and it was not really relevent to talk about it without the rest.
        </p>
        <p>I am writing this conclusion after participating in the general review of ISS between students and the teachers. I don't think that I truly understood the 
          philosophy of ISS until that point. What it aims to be is a series of modules, with mainly lectures and laboratories, designed to help us and give us 
          skills in our Innovative project. The way I experienced it, it was more many courses and modules with their own projects and deliverables, and then a big project 
          that had no real connection to them. This is probably due to the fact that our project comes from our initiative, so the scientific content in it does not 
          directly relate to what we see in 5ISS. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this does not mean that I was not satisfied with the teaching of the year. There were some really good and interesting modules, expecially Smart Devices. 
          To me, it really encapsulates the spirit of ISS as I see it. All the classes in the module flow well together, there are dedicated requirements for every background, 
          and you build a real tangible thing in the end that you can be proud of.
        </p>
        <p>The bet of proposing such an innovative teaching for every module is of course really hard to put in place, however I wish that more modules would reach the same 
          level of flexibility as this one, and I believe that each year will improve the quality of the formation.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Coming from a background in computer science, I was a little bit scared when I decided to join ISS. I was afraid that I would not be able to follow certain classes, notably 
          in networking or physics. However, I feel like the focus was not on reaching expert levels in technical skills from other domains, but rather know how to make these 
          domains work together in projects, and integrate everything. I think the most important skill that I learned this year was how to manage and work on a project involving 
          problematics that don't have anything to do with each other on a technical level, but are all as important and depend on each other. It may be due to our project, who add 
          a much bigger focus on product design and communication compared to the rest, but I really understand the Innovative part in the name of the cursus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The human sciences classes, and especially the Innovation and Psychology classes were some of my favorites of the year, allowing us to explore domains that were completely 
          out of the technical, software oriented flavor of the rest of the year. One of the gripe I could raise is that most of the modules (except Smart Devices) were really 
          tailored towards computer science students, so while it was pretty easy to follow them, I did not have the chance to improve my technical skills in most of them. 
        </p>
        <p>However, I feel like with how dense the year is in terms of deliverables and deadlines, feeling competent and able to solve most of the technical problems that I faced quickly 
          was a real asset in helping me stay organized and on top of things.
        </p>
        <p>I steel feel like I had to rush some assignments, notably in the Communication module taking place at the end of the year. It saddens me because it is one of the domains where 
          I am the least at ease in, but unfortunately between all the other projects I did not fin time to invest myself in it as much as I would hacve wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, I feel like if I had to choose which orientation to take f or my fifth year today, I would still decide to go with ISS with almost no hesitation. There were some clear issues 
          with deliverables and timetables, but those are all minors compared to what the formation offered me. Having no exams and working on so many different topics and 
          projects was really intense, but also really satisfying in the end. The end of the year was a real rush, especially for our Innovative project, but I am really happy with how it all 
          came out in the end.
